    <h1 id="rake-routes-for-grape">Rake routes for Grape</h1>

<p>If you are a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> developer using <a href="https://github.com/intridea/grape">Grape</a> you’ll miss a command similar to <code>rake routes</code> but listing the Grape generated routes. In order to have the same functionallity I’ve build a little rake task.</p>

<p>In your rails ( or rails-api ) project create this file <strong>/lib/tasks/grape.rake</strong> with this content:</p>

<div class="highlight ruby"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="n">namespace</span> <span class="ss">:grape</span> <span class="k">do</span>
  <span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s2">"routes"</span>
  <span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:routes</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:environment</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="no">API</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Root</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">routes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Then, you can call it inside your project like this:</p>

<div class="highlight shell"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>rake grape:routes
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>

<p>And this could be a sample output:</p>

<div class="highlight shell"><table style="border-spacing: 0"><tbody><tr><td class="gutter gl" style="text-align: right"><pre class="lineno">1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="nv">version</span><span class="o">=</span>v1, <span class="nv">method</span><span class="o">=</span>POST, <span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=</span>/customers<span class="o">(</span>.:format<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nv">version</span><span class="o">=</span>v1, <span class="nv">method</span><span class="o">=</span>GET, <span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=</span>/customers<span class="o">(</span>.:format<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nv">version</span><span class="o">=</span>v1, <span class="nv">method</span><span class="o">=</span>GET, <span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=</span>/customers/:id<span class="o">(</span>.:format<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nv">version</span><span class="o">=</span>v1, <span class="nv">method</span><span class="o">=</span>PATCH, <span class="nv">path</span><span class="o">=</span>/customers/:id<span class="o">(</span>.:format<span class="o">)</span>

<p>Written 20 years ago, true today too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The conspiracy toward success in America is immediacy. … Here today, gone tomorrow because yesterday’s following was nothing more than a tool in every individuals need for self-importance, entertainment, and social rituals. Art that has long lasting value cannot be appreciated by the majorities. Only the same, small percent will value arts patience as they always have. This is good. The ones who are unaware do not deserve false suggestions in their purchasing duties. <br />

    <h1 id="a-love-hate-relationship-with-code">A love-hate relationship with code</h1>

<p>I’ve always liked <a href="http://www.number27.org/">Jonathan Harris</a>, his different projects, his perspective and his path in general. This interview on <a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/jonathan-harris">The Great Discontent</a> have some great thoughts about coding which resonates a lot with my feelings about the same topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I frequently struggle with my relationship to coding. I’m not someone who adores the process of coding, but there is something about it that can be beautiful. Life is very messy and chaotic, but when you’re building a computer program, if it’s designed well and if you’re the only one working on it, it’s neither messy nor chaotic: it’s incredibly orderly. You know where everything goes and you can obsess over every little detail, so you can live in this perfect, imaginary universe. It’s kind of like the ultimate expression of my childhood impulse of hiding under a sheet fort and reading comic books all day. Code allows that on a much bigger level, where you can engineer a reality and then live within that reality for most of your days. That reality can be free of conflict, free of complexity and emotions, and I think there’s something appealing to a lot of coders about disappearing into such a space. It’s very utopian.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a highly controlled environment, too.
It is. But there is another part of me that recognizes how alienating that process can be when it comes to being in relationships with other human beings, connecting with other people, and even being genuinely awake to nature and to the world happening around you. When you’re living in your head, in these abstract, constructed realities of code, they don’t always map onto physical reality in a good way. That can be a little tricky sometimes, and I’ve found myself ping-ponging between two modes of existing: one is living in the perfect abstraction, and the other is living in the imperfect reality. Neither of them feel complete, so I’m constantly moving back and forth between them. I definitely have a love-hate relationship with code.</p>
