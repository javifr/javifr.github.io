&lt;p&gt;I like the concept of orchestra man, but Tom Thum takes it to a whole new level with his own mouth. Huge talent with the right amount of complexity, art and entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta Spirit last release is terrific.&lt;br /&gt;
I can say, the best album I’ve heard in YEARS. The kind of album that makes me make music, a collection of good big songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your real problem is that you don’t know what you think &lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes you have to write to figure it out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to live to figure out &lt;br /&gt;
Meticolous plans often don’t hold up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Less planning and more living &lt;br /&gt;
Burst the double bubble of comfort and convention &lt;br /&gt;
and just do stuff &lt;br /&gt;
even if you don’t know where it’ll lead &lt;br /&gt;
but because &lt;br /&gt;
This may sounds risky… and it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The greater risk is fear failure more than mediocrity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written 20 years ago, true today too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The conspiracy toward success in America is immediacy. … Here today, gone tomorrow because yesterday’s following was nothing more than a tool in every individuals need for self-importance, entertainment, and social rituals. Art that has long lasting value cannot be appreciated by the majorities. Only the same, small percent will value arts patience as they always have. This is good. The ones who are unaware do not deserve false suggestions in their purchasing duties. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Kurt Cobain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h1 id="a-love-hate-relationship-with-code"&gt;A love-hate relationship with code&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked &lt;a href="http://www.number27.org/"&gt;Jonathan Harris&lt;/a&gt;, his different projects, his perspective and his path in general. This interview on &lt;a href="http://thegreatdiscontent.com/interview/jonathan-harris"&gt;The Great Discontent&lt;/a&gt; have some great thoughts about coding which resonates a lot with my feelings about the same topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I frequently struggle with my relationship to coding. I’m not someone who adores the process of coding, but there is something about it that can be beautiful. Life is very messy and chaotic, but when you’re building a computer program, if it’s designed well and if you’re the only one working on it, it’s neither messy nor chaotic: it’s incredibly orderly. You know where everything goes and you can obsess over every little detail, so you can live in this perfect, imaginary universe. It’s kind of like the ultimate expression of my childhood impulse of hiding under a sheet fort and reading comic books all day. Code allows that on a much bigger level, where you can engineer a reality and then live within that reality for most of your days. That reality can be free of conflict, free of complexity and emotions, and I think there’s something appealing to a lot of coders about disappearing into such a space. It’s very utopian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a highly controlled environment, too.
It is. But there is another part of me that recognizes how alienating that process can be when it comes to being in relationships with other human beings, connecting with other people, and even being genuinely awake to nature and to the world happening around you. When you’re living in your head, in these abstract, constructed realities of code, they don’t always map onto physical reality in a good way. That can be a little tricky sometimes, and I’ve found myself ping-ponging between two modes of existing: one is living in the perfect abstraction, and the other is living in the imperfect reality. Neither of them feel complete, so I’m constantly moving back and forth between them. I definitely have a love-hate relationship with code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
